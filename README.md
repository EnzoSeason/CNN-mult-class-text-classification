# CNN-Mult-class text classification
> Project of classifying tweets of company **Limportant** into 13 categories

## 1. Highlights:
- Language: Python
- It uses convolutional neural network
- Deep learing package is keras with Tensorflow Backend
- Full-score, which combines precision and recall, is 0.70/1.00

## 2. Data:

### 2.1 Training:
- Training size: 100 000 tweets
- Input: text, category_id
- Output: a list of recommended category_id

### 2.2 Predicting:
- Input: text
- Output: a list of recommended category_id
